<p>In recent years, it seems like the world is becoming increasingly divided. Politics, social issues, and even scientific research, have all become incredibly polarized. This polarization has made it difficult to make progress on any issue, as it seems like both sides are too entrenched in their beliefs to budge. One key to bridging this divide may be the inclusion of more skeptics. Skeptics are individuals who question the status quo and challenge accepted knowledge. Rather than simply accepting what they are told, skeptics seek to uncover the truth by questioning authority and considering the evidence. This can lead to new ideas and insights that can help us move forward in a productive and positive manner.</p>

<p>The value of skeptics is especially evident in the scientific fields. Science is based on the idea that knowledge can be gained through careful observation, experimentation, and analysis. However, scientists can sometimes be too quick to accept the status quo, even in the face of evidence to the contrary. Skeptics are essential to the scientific process, as they help to ensure that new discoveries are tested and questioned before being accepted as fact. This helps to prevent false conclusions and poor decisions from being made, and ultimately helps to advance the field of science.</p>

<p>Skepticism can also help to challenge the power structures that exist in society. Many of these power structures are based on outdated or inaccurate beliefs, and without skeptics to question them, they can remain in place for generations. Skeptics can help to uncover new information and insights that can help to challenge and update these power structures, leading to a fairer and more just society. This is especially important in a democracy, as citizens need to be able to make informed decisions about their lives and their futures.</p>

<p>In conclusion, skeptics are essential to our society. They provide a necessary counterbalance to the status quo, and help to ensure that new ideas and discoveries are tested and questioned before being accepted as fact. This can help to bridge the divide between opposing sides, advance the field of science, and challenge outdated power structures. Therefore, it is essential that we continue to embrace and encourage skepticism in our society.</p>

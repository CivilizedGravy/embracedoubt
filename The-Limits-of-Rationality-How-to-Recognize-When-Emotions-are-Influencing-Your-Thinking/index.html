<p>One of the most common mistakes when making decisions is to assume that all decisions should be made rationally. This is a mistake because people are not robots, and we are influenced by our emotions when making decisions. It’s important to recognize when your emotions are influencing your thinking so that you can make better decisions. </p>

<p>The first step to recognizing when your emotions are influencing your thinking is to be aware of how you are feeling. Pay attention to how you are feeling in the moment and how that might be influencing your decisions. Ask yourself if you are feeling angry, frustrated, or scared, and how those feelings are influencing your thought process. </p>

<p>Another way to recognize when your emotions are influencing your thinking is to take a step back and look at the big picture. Ask yourself if this is a decision you will still feel good about in a week, or a month, or a year. Consider the consequences of your decision and if it will still make sense in the long run. </p>

<p>Finally, it’s important to try to gain some perspective. Sometimes we can get too caught up in our emotions and it can be hard to see the bigger picture. Talk to someone you trust who can provide a different perspective and help you think through the decision. This can help you recognize if your emotions are clouding your judgement and if there is another way to approach the situation. </p>

<p>Recognizing when our emotions are influencing our thinking can be difficult, but it’s an important skill to have. By being aware of how we are feeling and taking a step back to gain perspective, we can make more informed decisions that are not clouded by our emotions. </p>

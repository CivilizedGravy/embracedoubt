<p>It’s not uncommon to feel confident and sure of yourself in certain situations—especially when you’re well versed and experienced in a particular subject. But when that confidence turns into false certainty, it can be dangerous. False certainty can lead to tunnel vision and an unwillingness to accept any other viewpoint, which can be damaging in both personal and professional contexts.</p>

<p>So how can you recognize when you’re feeling overly confident and when you’ve crossed the line into false certainty? Here are a few tips:</p>

<p>First, be mindful of your thoughts and feelings when someone presents a different opinion or viewpoint. If you’re feeling frustrated, dismissive, or judgmental, that’s a sign that you’re feeling overly confident and possibly veering into false certainty. It’s important to take a step back, take a deep breath, and be open to the other person’s ideas.</p>

<p>Second, be aware of your body language. Are you leaning in and trying to take control of the conversation? Are you talking over the other person or cutting them off? This is a sign that you’re feeling overly confident and need to take a step back and listen.</p>

<p>Finally, be honest with yourself about your level of expertise. Are you really an expert on the subject at hand? Have you done the research and read up on the topic? If not, it’s important to recognize that you may not have all the knowledge and information needed to be sure of your opinion. </p>

<p>False certainty can be dangerous and can lead to bad decisions. Taking the time to recognize when you’re feeling overly confident and open yourself up to other viewpoints can help you make better decisions and foster healthy relationships.</p>

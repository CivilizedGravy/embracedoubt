<p>Technology has become deeply ingrained in our lives, from the way we work to the way we play. With such an integral role in our day-to-day lives, it’s important to be a responsible user of digital media. At the intersection of skepticism and technology, there are a few key steps to take that will help you be a responsible user of digital media.</p>

<p>The first step is to be aware of the potential risks of using digital media. Be aware of the information you are sharing, who you are sharing it with, and the security measures you have in place to protect your data. Don’t be afraid to ask questions and do your own research. It’s important to stay up-to-date on the latest news and developments in technology so you can make informed decisions about what you should and shouldn’t be using.</p>

<p>The second step is to be aware of the sources of the information you are consuming. Be sure to double-check your sources and verify the accuracy of the information you’re taking in before you believe it. Be sure to use trusted sources that are known for their reliability and accuracy. It’s also important to be aware of the biases that exist in digital media and do your best to be aware of how they might be affecting the information you’re taking in.</p>

<p>The third step is to be aware of the potential for misuse of digital media. Be aware of the potential for cyberbullying, scams, and other malicious activities that can occur on digital media platforms. Be sure to take steps to protect yourself by using strong passwords and other security measures. If you come across something that seems suspicious or malicious, it’s important to report it and not share it with others.</p>

<p>By taking these steps, you can be a responsible user of digital media and stay safe online. It’s important to remember that digital media is a powerful tool and can be used both positively and negatively. It’s up to you to make sure you’re using it responsibly and staying safe while doing so.</p>
